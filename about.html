      <h2>"Hello! Introducing to the world"</h2>
      <h1>DASIK BAND EVENTS PAGE 2022</h1>
      <p>Our taste for rock music begins with our father, at that time he had vynil LPs with a wide collection of bands such as Supertramp, The Beatles, Rolling Stones among others. In addition to this, he was part of the ESCOMIL student band. We were introduced to this type of music when we were 6 to 7 years old.</p>
      <p>When the 90's arrived, a cousin on my mother's side moved to the US, and he often sent us CDs of the new bands that were being born. In this way we had the privilege of listening to Grunge groups such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Crash Test Dummies, Collective Soul and many more groups whose music took many years to arrive in Ecuador and that influenced our musical tastes, encouraging us to form our first rock bands in High-School.</p>

      <h2>Post High-School Story</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>At university. we found out that they gave scholarships for being part of their cultural groups. They had groups of dance, choir, painting, cinema and among those groups we found the ENSEMBLE DE CUERDAS that was directed by Iván Jumbo. That club had the premise of doing instrumental covers, with classical guitars only, of "Pasillo", Samba, Andean music, classical music and many other different genres of music. This extra-academic activity opened up our musical horizons and had a great influence on our current compositions.</p>
      <p>At the same time, together with some friends, we created our first group named Doppler, with which we did several gigs and two original songs. We even took part in a music festival in Quito.</p>
      <p>Now, we are developing new music combining this influences and learning every day. We are very excited to present our first album as Dasik, "Árbol Blanco".</p>
